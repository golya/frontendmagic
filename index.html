            <p>What is HTML?</p>

            <p>
HTML is the lingua franca for publishing hypertext on the World Wide Web. It is a non-proprietary format based upon SGML, and can be created and processed by a wide range of tools, from simple plain text editors - you type it in from scratch - to sophisticated WYSIWYG authoring tools. HTML uses tags such as h1 and /h1 to structure text into headings, paragraphs, lists, hypertext links etc. Here is a 10-minute guide for newcomers to HTML. W3C's statement of direction for HTML is given on the HTML Activity Statement. See also the page on our work on the next generation of Web forms, and the section on Web history.

What is XHTML?
            </p>
            <p>
The Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML™) is a family of current and future document types and modules that reproduce, subset, and extend HTML, reformulated in XML rather than SGML. XHTML Family document types are all XML-based, and ultimately are designed to work in conjunction with XML-based user agents. XHTML is the successor of HTML, and a series of specifications has been developed for XHTML. See also: HTML and XHTML Frequently Answered Questions

Recommendations
            </p>
            <p>            
W3C produces what are known as "Recommendations". These are specifications, developed by W3C working groups, and then reviewed by Members of the Consortium. A W3C Recommendation indicates that consensus has been reached among the Consortium Members that a specification is appropriate for widespread use.
            </p>
            <p>
In general, XHTML specifications include implementations of their requirements in various syntaxes (e.g., XML DTD, XML Schema, RelaxNG). These implementations are normative, and are meant to be used either as building blocks for new markup languages (e.g., XHTML Modularization) or as complete markup language implementations (e.g., XHTML 1.1).

This document collects together into one definition all the specs that together form the current state of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as of 2010. The primary audience is CSS implementors, not CSS authors, as this definition includes modules by specification stability, not Web browser adoption rate.
